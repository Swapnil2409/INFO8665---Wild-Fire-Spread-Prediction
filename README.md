# INFO8665 â€“ Wildfire Spread Prediction

## Overview

This project leverages **machine learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, to predict the spread of wildfires. By integrating real-time environmental data and predictive modeling, we aim to mitigate the impact of wildfires on ecosystems, infrastructure, and human life.

## Project Goals

- Develop an **accurate wildfire prediction system** using **CNNs** and geospatial data.
- Enhance **emergency response and evacuation planning**.
- Provide **data-driven insights** to policymakers and disaster management teams.
- Support **sustainable land management** through AI-based environmental monitoring.

## Vision & Mission

**Vision:** To create a safer and more resilient world by using **machine learning-driven wildfire prediction** to reduce risks to people, property, and nature.

**Mission:** Empower decision-makers with **real-time predictive insights** to **proactively manage** wildfires, optimize **resource allocation**, and **safeguard communities**.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**

   - Historical and real-time wildfire datasets.
   - Weather, topography, vegetation, and drought indices.
   - Remote sensing and satellite imagery.

2. **Machine Learning Approach**

   - **CNNs for wildfire spread prediction** using fire masks and heatmaps.
   - Data augmentation and feature engineering.
   - Model training and validation using wildfire datasets.

3. **Deployment & Visualization**

   - **Dashboard for real-time fire risk assessment**.
   - **APIs** for integration with emergency response systems.
   - **Edge AI solutions** for remote monitoring.

## Key Use Cases

### Emergency Response Planning

- **Predictive fire masks** guide **resource allocation** for firefighters.
- **Optimized deployment** of personnel, water resources, and fire suppression tools.

### Evacuation Planning

- Predict fire-affected areas within **24 hours**.
- **Data-driven evacuation routes** to minimize casualties.

### Risk Assessment & Environmental Protection

- Identify high-risk areas using **geospatial data**.
- **Prevent cascading failures** by proactively managing infrastructure (e.g., power grids).
- Support conservation efforts by monitoring biodiversity and habitat loss.
